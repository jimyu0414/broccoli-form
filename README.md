This Simple App was developed with [Create React App]

This App is about implementing react-bootstrap 'Form' and 'Modal' to create an popup with form for user to sumbit and then fetching to external api and handle response with simple alerts.

DEMO link is attached: [DEMO](https://broccoli-invite-form.herokuapp.com/).


Additional packages include:
node-sass (for basic styling structue)
react-bootstrap (from building modal)
enzyme and enzyme-adapter-react-16 for adaptor (for unit testing)

To start the App, cd in the project directory and run 
### `npm start`

To test the App, run
### `npm test`

To build, run
### `npm run build`
It builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

If there are errors on starting, I suggest simple remove the node_modules folder and install npm again, then it should be all fine. (the starting errors normally happens when developer setup webpack in different operations systems)
